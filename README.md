MISSION FITNESS
=========

At Mission Fitness, we reward exercise with philanthropy. Every time you work out in our facility, we donate $1 to a charity partner of your choice. Our charity partners are all focused on global health, meaning your workouts make you healthy while also improving the health of others worldwide. The more you exercise, the more we give back.

1. Every day you exercise, we take $1 off your monthly fee. 
2. That $1 is donated to a charity of your choice. 
3. Our charitable partners use the money to create sports and recreation programs, promote nutrition and healthy eating, protect the environment, and fight disease â€“ all of which improve the health of people.
